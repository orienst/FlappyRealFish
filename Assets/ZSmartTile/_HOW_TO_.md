### HOW TO MAKE A SMART TILE (tl;dr)

1. Add a ZST_SmartTile component to any Game Object
2. Add sprites to the Sprites_* fields
5. Profit.

### HOW TO MAKE A SMART TILE (detailed)

1. Create an Empty Game Object in your scene. This will be your Smart Tile! Yay!

2. Add a ZST_SmartTile component to it. When you do this, a ZST_SnapToGrid component will be added *auto-magically*.

3. In the Inspctor, with the Smart Tile selected, click the arrows on the left to expand Sprites_center, Sprites_side, Sprites_corner Convex, and Sprites_corner Concave. These lists will contain choices the Smart Tile will use to create different edge pieces. See the example sprites in the Sprites/ folder to see what they look like.

4. For each set of sprites, set the number of sprites you'd like the list to contain in the Size field, hit "Enter," and then add the sprites you'd like.  See the example prefabs for reference.

5. Add any other components you'd like to your Smart Tile, like a BoxCollider2D perhaps, and then turn your Smart Tile into a Prefab by dragging it from the Hierarchy Panel into the Project Panel.

6. Copy the Smart Tile or drag in some copies of the Prefab and watch the tiles magically adjust! Wooooah!

7. Make MOAR!

8. Once you have a configuration you like, select all your Smart Tiles, and press the "Reroll Sprite" button in the Inspector and watch your tiles become ðŸŒˆ*diverse*ðŸŒˆ

9. Profit, of course.

### Q & A

**Q:** How do I make tiles different sizes?
**A:** Changing the Grid Size Length property on the ZST_SnapToGrid component will make the tile resize to fit the new grid, and use a grid of that size for snapping

**Q:** Diversity's great and all, but can I just make some tiles be the way I want them?
**A:** YES! If you give a list of tiles only ONE option, that tile will always use it. Say you always want your convex corners to be a particular sprite. Then you would make Sprites_cornerConvex be of size 1 and only accept that one sprite.

**Q:** I want to modify a property of the Sprite, but I can't! Everything is RUINED! How can I do this thing I want to do???
**A:** Each Smart Sprite is actually suuuper seeekritly made of 4 sprites arranged in a grid, but they're hidden! If you need to dig in there for any reason, you can click the "Show Children" button to unhide the children.  You can click it again ("Hide Children") to hide them.

**Q:** What's that Quadrants thing at the bottom...?
**A:** Yeah, don't touch that. It's just used to save data about your tile between scenes. If you really want, you can change it, but doing so overrides a lot of the automatic stuff, so... probably you don't want to actually do that?

**Q:** I found a bug! What do I do??
**A:** Report it to zbarryte@alum.mit.edu! I'll try and fix it if I can!

**Q:** I have a question. Whom can I ask?
**A:** Email zbarryte@alum.mit.edu! I'd love to answer it if I can!

**Q:** This tool is a terrible piece of garbage, and the developer is probably also a terrible piece of (human) gargabe. To whom can I complain?
**A:** TOO BAD
